						<h3 class="text-center project-color">Overview</h3>
						<p class="project-overview"><br />
							Bangladesh is heavily reliant on agriculture as a developing nation. Cultivation of
							Tomatoes is both economically beneficial and has great benefits health-wise. But
							due to unawareness and not knowing about the pathogen attacks, our farmers suffer
							greatly.
							<span style="background-color: rgb(241, 241, 99);"> this project, an efficient way is
								provided to identify
								and recognize the
								diseases that affect the cultivation of tomatoes in Bangladesh. The work was done
								on a custom dataset.</span>
						</p>
						<p class="project-overview">
							Here, 500 digital images of tomato leaves, including healthy and unhealthy, were collected
							from several crop fields of villages of
							Bangladesh. Then the images were pre-processed by resizing and normalization. Images were
							augmented for creating the variations.
							For augmentation on images, several fill_mode like the reflection, wrap, constant and
							nearest were considered. By augmentation, up
							to 2500 digital images were created. Then, labels were assigned on those images and encoded
							was done after that. 30 features
							combining GLCM, statistical, and color features were extracted. By using the Recursive
							Feature Elimination (RFE) technique, 15 best
							essential features were selected for leaf disease classification. The custom dataset was
							split into training and testing set by 80% and
							20% ratio. Model was trained using a Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and
							K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms. The
							models performance was evaluated considering accuracy and F1 score. It was found that Random
							Forest Classifier shows best result
							than the other models.<br />
						</p>
						<p class="project-overview"><br />
							Integrating this system into the backend server of an application, can be used to assist
							farmers in detecting plant diseases using leaf
							photos. The user will take a picture of a leaf from an impacted plant with a smartphone or
							camera that already has the suggested
							system's application installed. Users will be able to send photos of captured leaves to the
							proposed model on the backend server. The
							technology will detect the ailment based on the submitted photograph and deliver its
							findings to the user.
